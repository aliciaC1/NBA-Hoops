###Concept
The object of this NBA Basketball inspired game is to score the exact amount points as the listed "Target" score. Within a new game, each colored hoop is randomly assigned point values : 1 point (free throw), 2 points (field goal), or 3 points (three pointer). Shoot the right amount of shots to hit the target score and you WIN! Keep track of your score with the colored progress bar. Exceed the target score and you LOSE.
